        Hi, my name is William Lowrimore. I attended Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding
        Bootcamp, where I graduated with a cerfification in the MERN stack.  As I weaved my way
        through the program, learning and implementing front-end and back-end skills, I found 
        my strong suite and passion drawing me heavily into the front-end aspects of software 
        development.<br/><br/>

        Since completion of the full-stack bootcamp, I have been coding everyday.  I have been 
        broadening my knowledge and skills beyond that of the curriculum required for graduation.
        Although I am drawn more toward front-end development, I still find it extremely important 
        to continue strengthening my back-end skills as well.<br/><br/>

        To become fluent in only front-end development would leave a back-end developer (working on 
        the same project) at a disadvantage. Whether it be a collaborative or solo effort, I believe 
        that the Agile approach, proper naming conventions, and communication should be priorities 
        from beginning to end.<br/><br/>

        I make it a personal goal to learn a new skill everyday, as well as, revisiting previous 
        challenges that may have been a struggle to overcome.  I once had a teacher who said, "
        Practice doesn't make perfect...Perfect practice makes perfect.".  I liked that, and 
        decided to live by that in all that I do.

// Let me begin by saying, "This is the most excited 
//         I've been about my direction in life in a very long time!". I come from the 
//         banks of the Mississippi, where I was born and raised...Memphis, TN to be exact. 
//         I come from a family of musicians, artists, and (yes indeed) software 'techies'. 
//         I, myself, chose the path of music at a young age, and ran with it. Most of my 
//         professional years have been spent on the road and in recording studios. I toured, 
//         recorded and taught music. Music was my life! But...something was missing. I needed 
//         a change, a new start. So I picked up and moved on (a new city, a new life). I 
//         enrolled in Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I felt like I would 
//         be a perfect candidate to take on this challenge, express my love for problem 
//         solving, and to flex my creative muscles. I've enjoyed every second of it, and hope 
//         to make a very fruitful career of it. I am always learning, and always thirsty for 
//         knowledge. Finding this avenue is beyond exciting for me! I began this journey with 
//         only basic computer skills, and some graphic design experience, and now...well...let's 
//         just say, "I've come a long way!" With that said, please review my portfolio. 
//         You might find that I am willing and able to learn new skills, and adapt to new 
//         environments.
